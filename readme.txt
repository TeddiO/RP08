Sup, if you're downloading / looking at this, there's a few things you should probably be notified of.

* This script is old, and by old I mean it's now at least 4 years old. It was only maintained lightly for a few people with no real thought put into it, so features may not be 100%.
* This script should mostly be used for learning (albeit half the code is now depricated and out of date). So use it lightly.
* The script is useable without using a database, however nothing player related will save, and you'll get errors spewing out from time to time
* Ben wanted this script to be released early on (although once the donations came in, that ideal may have changed), but I suppose consider this fulfilling his wishes
* If specific features don't work, I may fix them assuming many people actually use this as a base or otherwise, otherwise don't expect anything
* Again, the script is OLD. Don't think you should be using GetTable(), because you shouldn't be.
* A few BB related features are missing. This is because they're BB only (ie advanced, radios, melon etc). No, you cannot have these.
* If there's any questions, feel free to go to www.bbroleplay.co.uk and post a query in the General Server Chat forum, or PM me (Teddi).
* Finally, I'd just like to thank those that made this script possible after Ben left, those being Cpf, Biff and Kaiden. You guys helped me out immensely, so thanks <3
* Whitefang (Dave_Parker) gets a mention because he'd complain if he didn't. And he's working on the new Roleplay script with me, so yeah, <3 to him too
* Enjoy.

To use this script to the full extent, you need Andy Vincents mysqloo module (http://www.facepunch.com/threads/933647-Gm_MySql-v1.0-OO-edition. ) along with a mysql database. If you don't know how to use either of these
You shouldnt be touching this script at all. I will NOT give support on how to install this script on a server.

To configure the mysql database etc, look inside init.lua (Under the GM:Initalize function).


Otherwise if you are going to use this as a Gamemode base, please keep the credits in the init.lua, just to be nice.
